# Rapid generalization in phonotactic learning
Data and code for Linzen &amp; Gallagher, ["Rapid generalization in phonotactic learning"](http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002656), to be published in *Laboratory Phonology*.

The `experigen` directory contains the scripts used to run the experiments, all based on [experigen](https://github.com/tlozoot/experigen) with minor modifications. All of the sound files we used as stimuli are included in the directory, for example in `experigen/exp1/resources/sounds` for Experiment 1. If you use experigen in your work, please cite it, as follows:
